// 05/31/2022 Retina_retrieve_xy_coordinates_from_polygon_roi_to_exclude_nonEC

// Vistreous vessels failed to be removed during dissection will show strong ERG staining and contaminate analysis results.
// Occasionally non-EC beyond the angiogenic front can also show weak ERG staining that may interfere with the analysis.
// Therefore, we usually draw one big polygon for all of the retina EC (not vistreous) to mathmatically (later in R)
// exclude contaminating signals before assigning vascular zones.

// Input are manually drawn and saved ROI (one polygon per retina) as zip files in the roi folder
// output is a txt file that has x y coordinates (as pixels) for each roi. 
// The txt output file will be used for downstream analysis of vascular zonation in R
// The script is basically the same as the one we used for vascular zonation (supp. file 3) but it's fine.

// More to know before you start
// Before you run this script, you need to open a stitched image (jpeg is fine) of the largest retina
// in the batch of retinas youâ€™re analyzing (make sure you use the largest retina to ensure correct coordinates being exported). 
// The input directory can only have .zip files and there cannot be any spaces in the file names so rename them if needed.
// When imagej prompts you for directory, just select the folder where all the roi files are in as the roi directory
// and then the "vascular_zonation" folder as the output folder

// adding column names to the final output txt file, 
// the results will appear in a "log" window because we used the "print" function
